I’m Abdelrahman Hamada

I’m interested in Software / Software side of Hardware and electronics (Embedded Systems).

I’m looking to collaborate on anything that brings value to the world

If you enjoyed reading any code I wrote with my two brain cells, I would appreciate it if you could leave a star on the repo. I simply enjoy writing code that makes me question what I wrote the next morning. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
